# Bill Wurtz Notebook GUI
note taker app designed to work with bill wurtz's notebook seen at https://billwurtz.com/notebook.html

# motive
was making my own website cause im bored asf and inspected bill wurtz's for inspiration. saw how time consuming that shit would take to write manually and decided to automate it

# how to run
its a python file bro cmon now
but once ur done taking notes and export to csv use the csv loader to make the final html page

# update

ended up making a cooler more better version looking back this one kinda sucked
